# `task-py`

## Overview

One day you need to write a script to process some data, so you sit down and write it. The filepath and other parameters
are hard-coded, but it works. A few days later, you need to do the same thing, but need to accept a filepath on the
command line and maybe one more parameter, so you refactor some functionality into functions and create a simple CLI
using `sys.argv`.  Then a coworker asks if he/she/they could use the script, so you finally break down and use `argparse`
to write a better CLI.  If this cycle sounds familiar, `task-py` can help by allowing you to skip steps one and two, while
writing interoperable, composable tools.
